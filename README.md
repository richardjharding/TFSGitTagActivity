TFSGitTagActivity
=================

A custom build activity to tag sources in a Team Foundation Server Git repository following a build


This Code activity is designed to be applied to a customised build template in Team Foundation Server 2013

Installation
--------------

The TfsGitTagActivity.dll and the libgit2sharp dependencies (LibGit2Sharp.dll and the NativeBinaries folder contents) need 
to be deployed to the build agents  - the simplest option is use the same instructions as [Community TFS Extensions project on codeplex]
